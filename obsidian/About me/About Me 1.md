# Tell Me About Yourself 
## Who I am

My name is Evan and I have worked in program analysis as a software engineer and researcher for about 6 years.

## Highlight reel

I've developed many representations and reasoning techniques in AI-assisted software development, I've worked closely with large financial companies to help them better understand the functionality of their legacy systems, and I love working with and learning from really smart, curious, and compassionate mentors and colleagues.

## Why I'm here.

I'm interested in Amazon because the career growth opportunities you offer and I want to get more experience working at very large scales. And it does get much larger scale than Amazon.

# Solved a big problem
## Defined FOM

### S.ituation:
1.  **Response Time too slow.**

1.  **Figure out a way to speed up analysis.**

### A.ction:
1.  **Transpiled COBOL to a Functional Language.**

### R.esult:
1.  **80% increase in analysis. Positive client feedback.**

## Implamented the linearizer
### S.ituation:
1.  **Needed to speed up a criticacl functionality in system (Reduce SE conditionals)**

### T.ask:
1.  **Design and implement linearizer**

### A.ction:
1.  **Designed a graph stitching algorithm from orignal graph**

### R.esult:
1.  **Slicer and linearizer reduced conditionals by 75%. 50% increase in SE**

## Defined the slicers
### S.ituation:
1.  **Needed to speed up a criticacl functionality in system (Reduce SE conditionals)**
